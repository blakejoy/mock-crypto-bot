### What is this repository for? ###
This is a mockup of a crypto currency trading bot. This project consisted of a group of 4 people. My role during the project was to develop the backend. I also worked on some of the front end utilizing javascript to make callbacks to the flask endpoints. I was able to use bittrex and coindesk api to gather real time coin data to use during the trading process. The project uses Python and Flask in order to demonstrate how one would use a bot to trade crypto. I had no prior experience with trading indicators and such so the code for the indicators may be a little messy.
