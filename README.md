### What is this repository for? ###
This is a mockup of a crypto currency trading bot. This project consisted of a group of 4 people. My role during the project was to develop the backend. The project uses Python and Flask in order to demonstrate how one would use a bot to trade crypto. I had no prior experience with trading indicators and such so the code for the indicators may be a little messy.
